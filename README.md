# RadioQueues

RadioQueues is queue manager which allows you to plan a radio program.

It supports multiple queues (e. g. for music, news, ads).

## Requirements

RadioQueues works in your browser. It requires permission to a folder on your filesystem in order to play audio files and store the queues. At the time of writing only Chrome and Edge support the FileSystem-API. Therefore RadioQueues does not work in Firefox at the moment.

RadioQueues consists of static files that need to be server by a server supporting https, unless the server runs on localhost.

## Current state of development

RadioQueues is under heavy development. Several key features are still on the TODO list
